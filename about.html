            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Lemongaba SDA Choir was founded in 2018 with a mission to share the love and hope of Jesus Christ through music. 
                What began as a small family group led by Sister Grace Jimmy, originally called the Grace Kids Choir, soon grew into a vibrant community choir. 
                By the end of 2018, new members joined, and in 2019, the choir officially became known as the Lemongaba SDA Church Choir, with Daniel Mark and Grace Jimmy as its first leaders and a membership of twenty.
                The choir faced challenges but grew stronger. In 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic, membership expanded to 28, with Stephine Charles and Eriga Rechard taking on leadership roles. 
                By 2022, the choir had 35 members and launched its first audio album with eight inspiring songs on October 22, directed by Eriga Rechard and Monica Minialla. This album marked a significant milestone, allowing the choir to begin professionally recording their music. 
                Today, the Lemongaba SDA Choir has released four audio albums and is working on its first video album. The choir remains dedicated to its mission, bringing comfort, joy, and spiritual encouragement to many through the power of music.</p>
